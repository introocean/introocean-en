# Introduction to Physical Oceanography, open-source edition
**Based on the work of Robert Stewart**

> Donâ€™t let the book or web pages grow into an encyclopedia. It is an INTRODUCTION, leaving details to more expert and focused publications (which could also be on the web server). Keep the book focused on the most important issues students need to know about. Today, satellite oceanography needs to be emphasized as most of our knowledge comes from satellites and drifters. 

> My only request is that the book not be offered for sale. It should be open source and available to everyone at no cost.
