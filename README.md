# Introduction to Physical Oceanography, open-source edition
**Based on the work of Robert Stewart**

Robert Stewart's "Introduction to Physical Oceanography" was 
the first oceanography textbook for many students. 
It was always the free high-quality source of basic 
oceanographic knowledge. Robert Stewart retired in 
2009 and did not update the book after that. 
With his permission, we now publish the latest 
version of the book's LaTeX source code on GitHub. 
Dr. Stewart gives his permission to update the book
by fixing errors and adding new information. He has 
only two conditions:

> Donâ€™t let the book grow into an encyclopedia. 
It is an INTRODUCTION, leaving details to more
expertand focused publications (which could also
be on the web server). Keep the book focused on the
most important issues students need to know about.
Today, satellite oceanography needs to be emphasized
as most of our knowledge comes from satellites and 
drifters. 

> My only request is that the book not be offered
for sale. It should be open source and available 
to everyone at no cost.

We are going to update the book through the usual
GitHub procedure with PRs and code review. Any
help and contributions from the oceanographic 
community will be greatly appreciated.
