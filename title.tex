\chapter{Preface}
This book is written for upper-division undergraduates and new
graduate students in meteorology, ocean engineering, and
oceanography. Because these students have a diverse background, I have
emphasized ideas and concepts more than mathematical derivations.

Unlike most books, I am distributing this book for free in digital
format via the world-wide web. I am doing this for two reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
\vitem Textbooks are usually out of date by the time they are
published, usually a year or two after the author finishes writing the
book. Randol Larson, writing in \textit{Syllabus}, states: ``In my
opinion, technology textbooks are a waste of natural
resources. They're out of date the moment they are published. Because
of their short shelf life, students don't even want to hold on to
them''---(Larson, 2002). By publishing in electronic form, I can make
revisions every year, keeping the book current.

\vitem Many students, especially in less-developed countries cannot
afford the high cost of textbooks from the developed world. This then
is a gift from the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration
\textsc{nasa} to the students of the world.
\end{enumerate} 

\section*{Acknowledgements}
I have taught from the book for several years, and I thank the many
students in my classes and throughout the world who have pointed out
poorly written sections, ambiguous text, conflicting notation, and
other errors.  I also thank Professor Fred Schlemmer at Texas A\&M
Galveston who, after using the book for his classes, has provided
extensive comments about the material.

I also wish to thank many colleagues for providing figures, comments,
and helpful information. I especially wish to thank Aanderaa
Instruments, Bill Allison, Kevin Bartlett, James Berger, Gerben de
Boer, Daniel Bourgault, Don Chambers, Greg Crawford, Thierry De Mees,
Richard Eanes, Peter Etnoyer, Tal Ezer, Gregg Foti, Nevin
S. Fu\v{c}kar, Luiz Alexandre de Araujo Guerra, Hazel Jenkins, Andrew
Kiss, Jody Klymak, Judith Lean, Christian LeProvost, Brooks Martner,

Joachim Ribbe, Will Sager, David Sandwell, Sea-Bird Electronics, Achim
Stoessel, David Stooksbury, Tom Whitworth, Carl Wunsch and many
others.

Of course, I accept responsibility for all mistakes in the
book. Please send me your comments and suggestions for improvement.

Figures in the book came from many sources. I particularly wish to
thank Link Ji for many global maps, and colleagues at the University
of Texas Center for Space Research. Don Johnson redrew many figures
and turned sketches into figures. Trey Morris tagged the words used in
the index.

I especially thank \textsc{nasa}'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the
Topex/Poseidon and Jason Projects for their support of the book
through contracts 960887 and 1205046.

The book was produced in \LaTeXe\ using TeXShop 2.14 on an Intel iMac
computer running OS-X 10.4.11. I especially wish to thank Gerben
Wierda for his very useful i-Installer package that made it all
possible, Richard Koch, Dirk Olmes and many others for writing the
TeXShop software package, and Andrew Kiss at the University of New
South Wales in Canberra Australia for help in using the hyperref
package. The \LaTeXe\ software is a pleasure to use. All figures were
drawn in Adobe Illustrator.
